# Windows 12
## What is it?
Windows 12 is an idea of microsoft. BUT, because they are taking WAY to long, I started myself something alike. <br>
All rights are for microsoft.

# Versions
## V0
In V0, I just start working on some of the small functions. But I will start with a small terminal based version.
### V0.0
In V0.0 I start with a small terminal based version of windows 12. So you can open and close documents, and maybe do a few extra things.
<br><br>
V0.0.1 will be a small start of the version where you can open a file editor, called notepad.
<br>
V0.0.2 is a version where the notepad works a bit better!

### V0.1
In this version I will add a falling matrix effect.
<br>
V0.1.0, the first try of it.
